                <div class="intro-lead-in">This group is for developers working on Apple platform (iOS/ Mac OS) as well as the ones who are using swift to develop cloud and server applications or willing to learn so. We would meet once a month, to learn from the expert speakers and share knowledge, in an informal, discussion format. The sessions would start with some teasers for beginners and provide enough and more pointers to the right resources to learn everything about Swift and the latest developments in swift. The expert speakers would share their knowledge, help you with swift hacks and answer your queries thereafter. Enigmatic, self driven and filled with mojo, Swift is an exciting new arena willing and able to revolutionise the programming world but the reiterated question we keep hearing everyone ask is: Have you switched? If you havenâ€™t found an answer to that yet, Swift Bengaluru is the place to be. If you have the answer, come share it with us. If you are interested in presenting at a future meetup, please send-in your nominations by messaging me. Our Mission: Introduce and educate people about swift and it's applications. Meet at least once a month, share ideas and knowledge about various use cases of swift.</div>
